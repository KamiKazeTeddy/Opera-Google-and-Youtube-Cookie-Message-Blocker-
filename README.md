Summary: Removes the Cookie Message from Google and YouTube (perfect for ingocnito-mode). Also removes the "Wanna login"-message from YouTube.

The summary clearly tells what this extension is about to do. 
If you use this extension, you give your permission to Google and Youtube that they are allowed to use cookies 
(just like when you press the "I agree" button), because without this permission you can't access these websites!
This extension doesn't block any cookies, it just removes the message about it. 
I created this extention, because I realy like to look up things fast in incognito mode and hate that I have to press "agree" again and again. 
Feel free to use the sourcecode.
This Addon is only active on google and youtube (see sourcecode for further information). 
Don't forget to allow the addon to access websites with searchresults and the incognitomode. (see about://extensions)
